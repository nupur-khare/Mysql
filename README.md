Theproject relies on a tech stack that includes Python for scripting, utilizing version 3.x, and a MySQL database for data storage. 
To interact with the MySQL database, the script employs the `mysql-connector-python` library. Additionally, it leverages the `pandas` library 
for data manipulation and analysis, and the `sqlalchemy` library for SQL query execution. The tech stack ensures a seamless integration between 
Python and the MySQL database, providing a robust foundation for managing and analyzing employee salary data.
